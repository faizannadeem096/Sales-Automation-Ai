Project Title: Automated Sales Analysis and Content Generation

Overview:
This project automates the analysis of sales data using a combination of vectorization, GPT-based content generation, and retrieval techniques. It processes CSV sales data into vectorized embeddings and allows for natural language queries about the data, providing insights and analysis via a RESTful API.

Workflow:

1. Data Loading and Preparation:
Sales data is loaded from a CSV file using CSVLoader.
The data is chunked into smaller pieces using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for efficient embedding generation.

2. Vectorization:
Text chunks are converted into vectorized embeddings using the HuggingFace embedding model.
These embeddings are stored in a Chroma vector store for later retrieval.

3. Content Retrieval:
The stored embeddings allow similarity-based retrieval of data when queried.
Chroma vector store acts as a retriever to fetch relevant chunks of information.

4. Content Generation:
 GPT-based models (gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct) generate natural language insights based on the queried data.

5. REST API:
 Flask serves as the backend framework.
Exposed endpoints:
/api/rep_performance: Analyze the performance of a specific sales representative.
/api/team_performance: Summarize overall team performance.
/api/performance_trends: Analyze trends and provide forecasts based on specified time periods.
Query processing integrates LLMs and retrieved embeddings for precise results.

6. Usage:
Users interact via the API by providing parameters such as rep_id or time_period.
Responses include detailed analyses, trends, and forecasts in JSON format.

Modules and Technologies:
Data Processing: LangChain's document loaders, text splitter, and Chroma vector stores.
Machine Learning: HuggingFace embeddings and OpenAI GPT models for vectorization and generation.
Backend: Flask for API endpoints.
Environment: Python with .env configuration for secure token management.

Flow Summary:
Load and chunk sales data.
Convert text into vector embeddings.
Persist embeddings in Chroma.
Use an LLM to process user queries and generate insights.
Serve insights via Flask API endpoints.
